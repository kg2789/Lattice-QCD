Pure Gauge Lattice QCD Code

This is a Lattice QCD Code that I created for Pure Gauge Theory using Monte Carlo Methods for SU(3).

Problem1Final is the equilibirum method that I have implemented.

HitMethod is essentially Problem1Final, but works faster and implements the Hit Method which equilibriates the lattice with respect to it's neighbours.

Problem2 is the calculation of Wilson Loops of arbirtary dimensions RxT.

FiveDmat and Final2Dmat are classes I use to help store various variables.

Comments are written in the code to make it more readable. 

This is for personal purposes so not very well made.
